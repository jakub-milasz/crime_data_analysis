# Crime Data Analysis in Krakow

This project involves an analysis of crime data from Krakow. The aim of the project is to identify areas with increased intensity of recorded offenses in the city of Krakow. As part of the analysis:

- I performed data preprocessing in ArcGIS.

- I used the DBSCAN and HDBSCAN clustering algorithms to group crimes based on their features.

- I analyzed the clustering results to identify patterns and areas with increased criminal activity.

- I compared these two algorithms.
