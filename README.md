# Crime Data Analysis in Krakow

This project involves an analysis of crime data from Krakow. As part of the analysis:

- I performed data preprocessing in ArcGIS.

- I used the DBSCAN and HDBSCAN clustering algorithms to group crimes based on their features.

- I analyzed the clustering results to identify patterns and areas with increased criminal activity.

- I compared these two algorithms.
